A Snake In TIme is basically the ol snake game but now our snake can rewind time on every death and has the ability to slow down time. But such power comes at a cost, use it wisely!!

Play it on<a href="https://divine-sense.itch.io/asnakeintime">Itch</a>.

Built using Unity's URP Scriptable Render pipeline, allowing us to use some really cool 2D lights.

## Technologies Used and Technical Highlights

- Unity as the game engine
- Universal Render Pipeline and 2D lights
- Custom data structure to track the snake's movement for the time rewind mechanic
- Art using Aseprite
- Music in Bosca Ceoil

## Learning, Motivation and closing thoughts

* Design and develop a time rewind mechanic
* Recreate the classic snake game
